            HOW TO CARE FOR YOUR SKIN

        </font>
    </h1>
<p style="color:red;"> Your skin is the most important part of your body as it is the largest part of your body. Hence, it is imperative that you pay sufficient attention to your skin and provide ample nourishment to it.
For starters, if your skin is rough and you spend excessive hours of the day working out under the sun, it is extremely important that you come home and take a bath, and apply extensive soaping to all parts of your body. Once you are done, come out and apply a good quality moisturizer to your skin to reduce the effects of the sun and prevent the skin from hardening further. Then, leave it one for quite some time. Before going to sleep however, it is suggested that readers apply a fairness cream on their face and hands so that the sunâ€™s harmful ultra violet rays should not be able to damage your skin further and that it remains under good care.
The next thing to do is to apply lots of sun screen or sun block before going to work. Make sure that the sun block or sun screen that you use has a high UVA and UVB rating, as this is what would help protect you from the damaging ultra violet rays of the sun.</p>
